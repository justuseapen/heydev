## Codebase Patterns
- Database schema in `server/src/db/schema.ts` uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite
- Use `text("column", { enum: enumArray })` for enum columns with `notNull().default("value")` for defaults
- Use `integer("column")` for nullable timestamp columns (null = not set)
- Export type constants like `conversationStatuses` as const arrays for type safety

## 2026-01-14 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added status, readAt, and archivedAt columns to conversations table
- Files changed: server/src/db/schema.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Schema uses Drizzle ORM patterns - follow existing conventions
  - Timestamps are stored as integers for readAt/archivedAt (Unix timestamps)
  - Status uses text with enum constraint for type safety
  - Added ConversationStatus type export for use in other files
